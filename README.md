# ISEC243-Project
This project extracts method-level metrics from Android APKs using DroidASAT, computes statistical summaries per metric, labels samples as benign (0) or malware (1), and consolidates them into a dataset. Multiple scikit-learn classifiers are then evaluated via accuracy, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
